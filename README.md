# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to apply machine learning to predict the risk of approving credit. Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans. Therefore, we will employ different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes.

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

## Summary
Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
